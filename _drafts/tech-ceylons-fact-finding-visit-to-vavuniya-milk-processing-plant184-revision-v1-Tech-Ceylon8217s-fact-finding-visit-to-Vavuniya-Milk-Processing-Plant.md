  Upon a directive from the Northern Province Commissioner of Co-operative Development Mr. P. Vageshan,  Tech Ceylon Social Ventures recently undertook a fact finding visit to the Vavuniya Milk Processing Plant in Puthukulam, Vavuniya.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The Vavuniya Milk Processing Plant was established in 2008 with funds from international aid organisations such as Oxfam International, the UNDP, and the USAID . The plant is an impressive facility with an estimated processing capacity of 1500 liters per day. Aside from housing modern equipment, the plant also has its own advanced milk testing and quality control laboratory.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The processing plant, however, has been dormant since May 2015.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The objects of the visit were to provide (i) an independent assessment of the present state of the plant and the installed equipment, (ii) identify the underlying reasons why production stalled, and (iii) list the measures to be taken to recommence  operations.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The Tech Ceylon team headed by Seralathan Seran, a  mechanical engineer by profession, found that the plant suffers from several critical equipment failures &#8211; pasteurizer, cream separator, homogenizer, and incubator are all in need of repair or service. The pasteurizing unit, in particular, has faced recurring faults due to large quantities of calcium phosphate deposits formed during milk fouling.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  But these technical issues are only one aspect of a complex myriad of shortcomings.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  In fact, technical failures themselves owe in large part to the limited training offered to the workers and the absence of an in-house technical supervisor. The quality control laboratory, for instance, was scarcely used during the time when the plant was in operation. Moreover, there are economic considerations that hinder the regular functioning of the plant. Local dairy farmers prefer to sell their milk to large private companies that offer a higher per liter price than the processing plant.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  In many ways, the Vavuniya Milk Processing Plant is a pointer to common problems facing business and livelihood initiatives in the north-east. Similar INGO funded projects in the region &#8211; rice mills, seafood processing facilities, and so on &#8211; are now either running at a loss or defunct. While much of the discourse on post-war development focuses on physical resources and infrastructure, there is an acute shortage of skilled workers and technologists in these areas. Millions of rupees of investment have failed to bear fruit as a result of a combination of bad management and poor business strategy.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Tech Ceylon will assist the Vavuniya Milk Processing Plant management with staff training and technical consultancy as they look to revive production after a long break.
