Tech Ceylon Social Ventures is a non-profitable organisation that started an year ago. It has been formed by a group of Sri Lankan professionals, mainly engineers and technologists, that are interested in using technology as the main tool for economic development, poverty alleviation, environmental protection, and so on. As of now Tech Ceylon predominantly operates in the North and East provinces of Sri Lanka. Our expert engineers, technologists, and designers aim to work seamlessly with government and semi-government organisations, charitable bodies and private organisations to deliver sustainable projects. Within our short lifespan, we have collaborated closely with producer co-operatives, contributing with feasibility and technology studies, leading to the awarding of a number of projects by the government. Furthermore, we have also recommended a number of development activities to be included in the budget for 2018, some of which have been included in the preliminary budget speech. We mainly concentrate on the following areas:

1. Rural economic development of the war-torn areas by concentrating on basic industries, for agriculture and fisheries, and value added products

2. Influencing government policy w.r.t. the engineering and technology sector

3. Effective educational practices for the region and the country to become environment friendly knowledge-based economies

4. Evaluating the appropriateness of industries in renewables, information technology, high-tech, and other emerging technologies, and creating a technology road map for the region, promoting it with the government, and actively partake in its implementation.

5. Tapping into the vast financial and technological resources available within the Sri Lankan diaspora, by actively identifying and promoting investments.
